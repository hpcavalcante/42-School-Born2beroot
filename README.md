# Born2beroot
In this project we have to create our own virtual machine and set up as a server by following specific rules. 

You must choose as an operating system either the latest stable version of Debian (no
testing/unstable), or the latest stable version of CentOS.

In my case I choose Debian. <b> So this following tutorial is only for a Debian use. </b>

### Mandatory:
> 1. Choose between two Linux-based distribuitions: `CentOs` or `Debian`.
> 2. Create, understand the concept about `LVM` partitions and encrypted partitions.
> 3. Install and configure `SSH services` for running on specific ports.
> 4. Configure `UFW firewall` to allow only specifics connections to your server.
> 5. Set-up hostnome and a strong password policy for users.
> 6. Install and configure `sudo` to specific users.
> 7. Create a monitoring script, that displays specific information about your server every 10 minutes.

### Bonus part:
> 1. Set-up a different layout of partitioning, more partitions are required for this part (as well as more disk space).
> 2. Set-up a functional `WordPress` website with the guidelines provided.
> 3. Set-up a webserver service of your choice and justify.
